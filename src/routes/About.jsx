    <p>hi, i'm binh le. 20. vietnamese.</p>
    <p>i called this page binh letters cause of the word play i thought was funny</p>
    <p>i like to think of myself as a very passionate person. i mean it might just be me in my early twenties wanting to change the world and impact it in a positive light. but you'll find my talking about how cool people are for innovating and how smart people can be from looking at their legacy.</p>
    <p>i don't think i'm that smart. but man do i try to work hard and learn as many things as possible. it might be this attitude that helped me graduate at the top of my school, get into every vietnamese college (can't say the same for the u.s. ones), and gain substantial success in social media.</p>
    <p>i really want to succeed in this tech world now. even given the prevalence of ai. even given the kids who coded since they was 6. i hope that showing up and persisting each day through all the struggles will pay off.</p>
